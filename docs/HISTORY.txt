=========

  [thefunny42]

* Handle changed signature for widget extract method in z3c.form > 1.9.0
  [davisagli]

  fieldset 'move' utility function.
  [davisagli]

  [davisagli]

* Don't display an 'Apply changes' button if you don't define an
  update_schema.
  [thefunny42]

* Declare xmlnamespace into 'layout.pt' and 'subform.pt' templates

* Added support for an editsubform_factory for an EditForm so you can
  override the default behavior for a sub form now.

* Changed css in crud-table.pt for a table to "listing" so that tables
  now look like plone tables.

* Copy translation files to an english folder, so if your browser
  negociate to ``en,nl``, you will get english translations instead of
  dutch ones (like expected).
  [thefunny42]

  manually in a CRUD form.

0.5.2 - 2008-08-28
------------------

* Add a namespace traversal adapter that allows traversal to widgets. This
  is useful for AJAX calls, for example.

0.5.1 - 2008-08-21
------------------

* Add batching to ``plone.z3cform.crud`` CrudForm.

* Look up the layout template as an IPageTemplate adapter. This means that
  it is possible for Plone to provide a "Ploneish" default template for forms
  that don't opt into this, without those forms having a direct Plone
  dependency.

* Default to the titleless form template, since the layout template will
  provide a title anyway.

* In ``plone.z3cform.layout``, allow labels to be defined per form
  instance, and not only per form class.

0.5.0 - 2008-07-30
------------------

* No longer depend on <3.5 of zope.component.

0.4 - 2008-07-25
----------------

* Depend on zope.component<3.5 to avoid ``TypeError("Missing
  'provides' attribute")`` error.

* Allow ICrudForm.add to raise ValidationError, which allows for
  displaying a user-friendly error message.

* Make the default layout template CMFDefault- compatible.

0.3 - 2008-07-24
----------------

* Moved Plone layout wrapper to ``plone.app.z3cform.layout``.  If you
  were using ``plone.z3cform.base.FormWrapper`` to get the Plone
  layout before, you'll have to use
  ``plone.app.z3cform.layout.FormWrapper`` instead now.  (Also, make
  sure you include plone.app.z3cform's ZCML in this case.)

* Move out Plone-specific subpackages to ``plone.app.z3cform``.  These
  are:

  - wysywig: Kupu/Plone integration

  - queryselect: use z3c.formwidget.query with Archetypes

  Clean up testing code and development ``buildout.cfg`` to not pull
  in Plone anymore.
  [nouri]

* Relicensed under the ZPL 2.1 and moved into the Zope repository.
  [nouri]

* Add German translation.
  [saily]

0.2 - 2008-06-20
----------------

* Fix usage of NumberDataConverter with zope.i18n >= 3.4 as the
  previous test setup was partial and did not register all adapters
  from z3c.form (some of them depends on zope >= 3.4)
  [gotcha, jfroche]

* More tests
  [gotcha, jfroche]

0.1 - 2008-05-21
----------------

* Provide and *register* default form and subform templates.  These
  allow forms to be used with the style provided in this package
  without having to declare ``form = ViewPageTemplateFile('form.pt')``.

  This does not hinder you from overriding with your own ``form``
  attribute like usual.  You can also still register a more
  specialized IPageTemplate for your form.

* Add custom FileUploadDataConverter that converts a Zope 2 FileUpload
  object to a Zope 3 one before handing it to the original
  implementation.  Also add support for different enctypes.
  [skatja, nouri]

* Added Archetypes reference selection widget (queryselect)
  [malthe]

* Moved generic Zope 2 compatibility code for z3c.form and a few
  goodies from Singing & Dancing into this new package.
